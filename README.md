<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



The Json Blog started back the summer, during a coding program we had a rubber ducky in the room and I named it Json, Json was the class .

Here's why:
* If you have an awesome place for camping, you can quickly create an account, create a campground with description, price and photos.
* A user can review the campground base on his/her experience.
* When you see an awesome looking campground, please share  :smile:

Of course, no campring area would be complete without a map to help you quickly find out what direction to head up for, That's why Yelpcamp counts
with an awesome interacting map, pinned right on top of your next camping paradise. Geocoding is also put in place to make sure the user creating a campground
will also be able to display its location accurately.
