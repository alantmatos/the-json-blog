<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



The Json Blog started back in 2022 summer, during a coding program I was on, we had a rubber ducky in the classroom and I named it Json, Json was the class's mascot, and we would talk to Json and explain the code everytime we were stuck with some bug and Json would help us figure it out.
For every situation I would create a blog post and sigh it as Json.
It was a fun experience and by the end of the program everyone knew and enjoyed Json's help.
Sadly "json's" original posts were lost when I had to reinstall my OS since the app wasn't deployed.
